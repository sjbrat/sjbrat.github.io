James Byrd Jr. May 2, 1949 - June 7, 1998 was a black man who was murdered by three white supremacists in Jasper, Texas, on June 7, 1998. Shawn Berry, Lawrence Brewer, and John King dragged Byrd for three miles behind a pickup truck along an asphalt road. Byrd, who remained conscious throughout most of his ordeal, was killed about halfway through the dragging when his body hit the edge of a culvert, severing his right arm and head. The murderers drove on for another ​1 1⁄2 miles (2.4 km) before dumping his torso in front of a black cemetery in Jasper.[1][2] Byrd's lynching-by-dragging gave impetus to passage of a Texas hate-crimes law. It later led to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, commonly known as the Matthew Shepard Act, which became federal law in 2009.

Sandra Bland February 7, 1987 - July 13, 2015  

Sandra Bland was a 28-year-old African-American woman who was found hanged in a jail cell in Waller County, Texas, on July 13, 2015, three days after being arrested during a traffic stop.[1] Her death was ruled a suicide. It was followed by protests against her arrest, disputing the cause of death, and alleging racial violence against her.

Bland was pulled over for a traffic violation on July 10 by State Trooper Brian Encinia. The exchange escalated, resulting in Bland's arrest and charge for assaulting a police officer. The arrest was partially recorded by Encinia's dashcam and by a bystander's cell phone. After authorities reviewed the dashcam footage, Encinia was placed on administrative leave for failing to follow proper traffic stop procedures.

Emmett Louis Till July 25, 1941 – August 28, 1955

was a 14-year-old African American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after being accused of offending a white woman in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder and the fact that his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.

Tamir Rice June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014  

a 12-year-old African-American boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), by a white police officer, occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. The shooting by officer Timothy Loehmann resulted in Tamir Rice's death. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded after receiving a police dispatch call of a black male that "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people".[3][4][5] A caller reported that a male was pointing "a pistol" at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At the beginning of the call and again in the middle he says of the pistol "it's probably fake".[6] Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated "he is probably a juvenile".[7] However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch.[8][9] The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled "show me your hands" through the open patrol car window. Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw: "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out".[10][11][12] In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso.[4][13] He died on the following day.[14]

Eric Garner September 15, 1970 – July 17, 2014

On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner died in Staten Island, New York City, after a New York City Police Department (NYPD) officer put him in a headlock or chokehold for about 15 to 19 seconds while arresting him. NYPD policy prohibits the use of chokeholds. The officer denied choking Garner, but the New York City Medical Examiner's Office report stated "Cause of Death: Compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police" and "Contributing Conditions: Acute and chronic bronchial asthma; Obesity; Hypertensive cardiovascular disease." In addition, the filming of the incident brought police brutality into wider public awareness.

Michael Brown Jr. May 20, 1996 - August 9, 2014

On the afternoon of August 9 in the predominantly African American community of Ferguson, Missouri, a convenience store security video captured the six-foot-four Brown pushing a clerk into a display case as Brown stole a pack of cigars. Soon afterward, Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of the street when they encountered Darren Wilson, a white police officer, who ordered them onto the sidewalk. It is unclear if Wilson was aware of the convenience store robbery. Moments later, a physical altercation between Brown and Wilson ensued, resulting in Wilson shooting the unarmed Brown at least six times, twice in the head.

Christian Taylor October 13, 1995 - August 7, 2015

On August 7, 2015, surveillance videos at an Arlington car dealership show Taylor pulling up at the front of the dealership around 1:00 a.m. Taylor began wandering around the dealership parking lot before smashing the windows of several vehicles. A security guard then called the 911 and six Arlington police arrived at the scene.  There they discovered that Taylor had driven his car through the dealership’s window and entered its showroom on foot. While five officers remained outside of the showroom, anticipating that they could capture Taylor without incident, Brad Miller—a 49-year old rookie police officer still on probation and without previous policing experience—pursued Taylor inside the dealership on his own. Miller confronted Taylor, ordering him to get down on the showroom floor.  What occurred next is uncertain, but Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson later stated that Taylor refused to comply with Officer Miller’s orders and began to actively advance toward the officer.  Miller shot Taylor, who was about seven feet away.  As Taylor continued to approach Miller, the officer shot him again three times, killing him.

Miller was fired four days after the shooting death of Christian Taylor. A grand jury in Arlington, however, did not charge him with any crime related to the shooting death of Taylor.  An autopsy revealed that Taylor had a mixture of drugs in his system at the time of his death, including marijuana and a powerful hallucinogen LSD-like substance nicknamed N-Bomb.

Alton Sterling June 14, 1979 – July 5, 2016

On July 5, 2016, Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, was shot dead at close range by two white Baton Rouge Police Department officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The officers were attempting to control Sterling's arms, and Sterling was shot by them after reportedly reaching for the gun in his pocket.[4] Police were responding to a report that a man in a red shirt was selling CDs and that he had used a gun to threaten a man outside a convenience store.[5] The shooting was recorded by multiple bystanders.

Paul O'Neal Age 18 Died July 28, 2016

The shooting of Paul O'Neal occurred on July 28, 2016, when he was shot in the back by Chicago Police Department officers following a grand theft auto chase.[1] O'Neal, 18, struck two police cars, a parked car, and a police officer while operating a stolen Jaguar. Police say that O'Neal, who was unarmed, fled from the vehicle after the chase and refused to stop.[2] The shooting was classified by the medical examiner as a homicide. The three officers who discharged their weapons were removed from duty following a preliminary investigation. Chicago's use-of-force policy specifically prohibits police from shooting into a car when the vehicle represents the only danger

Keith Lamont Scott February 3, 1973 – September 20, 2016

He was married and had seven children. His neighbors stated that he had previously suffered brain damage in an accident and had difficulty communicating. They said he often parked his truck in a shaded part of the apartment parking lot while waiting for his son's school bus in the afternoon, as his brain injury limited him from staying in the direct sun for long periods of time.

The shooting incident occurred before 4:00 p.m. in the parking lot of the Village at College Downs apartment complex, near the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) officers were searching there for an unrelated suspect with an outstanding warrant. According to CMPD Chief Kerr Putney, officers saw Scott exiting a parked vehicle while holding a handgun, then returning to his vehicle, then exiting again as officers approached him. At a news conference on September 22, Putney stated that Scott did not comply with police officer's instructions to "drop the weapon"; Putney said: "The officers gave loud, clear, verbal commands which were also heard by many of the witnesses. Putney described Scott as an "imminent deadly threat."

Laquan McDonald September 25, 1997 – October 20, 2014

Shortly before 10:00 p.m., police were called to investigate McDonald at 4100 South Pulaski Road, responding to reports that he was carrying a knife and breaking into vehicles in a trucking yard at 41st Street and Kildare Avenue. When officers confronted McDonald, he used a knife with a 3-inch (7.5 cm) blade to slice the tire on a patrol vehicle and damage its windshield. McDonald walked away from police after numerous verbal instructions from officers to drop the knife, at which point responding officers requested Taser backup, according to radio recordings released December 30, 2015, to Politico and NBC Chicago in response to Illinois Freedom of Information Act requests.

Video of the shooting shows that Van Dyke was advancing on McDonald, while McDonald was walking away from Van Dyke when the first shot was fired. The first shot hit McDonald, who spun and fell to the ground. As McDonald lay on the ground, still holding the knife, Van Dyke fired more shots into him. In total, Van Dyke fired 16 shots at McDonald in 14–15 seconds, expending the maximum capacity of his 9 mm semi-automatic firearm. Van Dyke was on the scene for less than 30 seconds before opening fire and began shooting approximately six seconds after exiting his car. The first responding officer said that he did not see the need to use force, and none of the at least eight other officers on the scene fired their weapons.

Laquan McDonald was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 10:42 p.m.

Akai Kareem Gurley Age 28 Died November 20, 2014

a 28-year-old man, was fatally shot on November 20, 2014, in Brooklyn, New York City, United States, by a New York City Police Department officer. Two police officers, patrolling stairwells in the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)'s Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York, Brooklyn, entered a pitch-dark, unlit stairwell, one of them, Officer Peter Liang, 27, with his firearm drawn. Gurley and his girlfriend entered the seventh-floor stairwell, fourteen steps below them. The shooting was declared an accidental discharge; the bullet ricocheted off the wall and Gurley was fatally struck once in the chest.

Walter L. Scott February 9, 1965 – April 4, 2015

The Shooting of Walter Scott occurred on April 4, 2015, in North Charleston, South Carolina, following a daytime traffic stop for a non-functioning brake light. Scott, an unarmed black man, was murdered by Michael Slager, a white North Charleston police officer.[1][2] Slager was charged with murder after a video surfaced which showed him shooting Scott from behind while Scott was fleeing, and which contradicted his police report. The race difference led many to believe that the shooting was racially motivated, generating a widespread controversy.

Freedie Carlos Gray, Jr,  August 16, 1989 – April 19, 2015

On April 12, 2015, Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr., a 25-year-old black man, was arrested by the Baltimore Police Department for possessing what the police alleged was an illegal knife under Baltimore law.[2] While being transported in a police van, Gray fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center.[3][4] Gray died on April 19, 2015; his death was ascribed to injuries to his spinal cord.[4] On April 21, 2015, pending an investigation of the incident, six Baltimore police officers were suspended with pay.[3]

The circumstances of the injuries were initially unclear; eyewitness accounts suggested that the officers involved used unnecessary force against Gray during the arrest—a claim denied by all officers involved.[3][4][5] Commissioner Anthony W. Batts reported that, contrary to department policy,[6] the officers did not secure him inside the van while driving to the police station; this policy had been put into effect six days prior to Gray's arrest, following review of other transport-related injuries sustained during police custody in the city, and elsewhere in the country during the preceding years.[7] The medical investigation found that Gray had sustained the injuries while in transport.[8][9] The medical examiner's office concluded that Gray's death could not be ruled an accident, and was instead a homicide, because officers failed to follow safety procedures "through acts of omission."[10] On May 1, 2015, the Baltimore City State's Attorney, Marilyn Mosby, announced her office had filed charges against six police officers after the medical examiner's report ruled Gray's death a homicide

Samuel DuBose March 12, 1972 – July 19, 2015

On July 19, 2015, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Samuel DuBose, an unarmed black man, was fatally shot by Ray Tensing,University of Cincinnati police officer, during a traffic stop for a missing front license plate and a suspended driver's license. Tensing fired after DuBose started his car. Tensing stated that DuBose had begun to drive off and that he was being dragged because his arm was caught in the car. Prosecutors alleged that footage from Tensing's bodycam showed that he was not dragged, and a grand jury indicted him on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter. He was then fired from the police department. He was released on bond before trial. A November 2016 trial ended in mistrial after the jury became deadlocked. A retrial begun in May 2017 also ended in a hung jury. The charges against Tensing were later dismissed with prejudice.

On July 6, 2016, Philando Castile,[a] a 32-year-old black American, was pulled over while driving in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and killed by Jeronimo Yanez, a St. Anthony, Minnesota police officer. Castile had been driving a car at 9:00 pm with his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, and her four-year-old daughter when he was pulled over by Yanez and another officer in a suburb of Saint Paul, MN.[3][4] After being asked for his license and registration, Castile had told Officer Yanez that he had a firearm, to which Yanez replied "Don't reach for it then", and Castile said "I'm, I, I was reaching for..." Yanez said "Don't pull it out", Castile replied "I'm not pulling it out", and Reynolds said "He's not..." Yanez repeated "Don't pull it out"[5] and then shot Castile seven times.[6]

The shooting achieved a high profile[7] from a live-streamed video on Facebook made by Reynolds in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.[8] In the video, she is talking with Yanez while a mortally injured Castile lies slumped over, moaning slightly and his left arm and side bloody.[9] The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office said that Castile had sustained multiple gunshot wounds and reported that he died at 9:37 p.m. in the Hennepin County Medical Center, about 20 minutes after being shot

Korryn Gaines - Age 23 Died August 1, 2016

The shooting of Korryn Gaines occurred on August 1, 2016, in Randallstown, Maryland, near Baltimore,[1] resulting in the death of Gaines, a 23-year-old woman, and the shooting of her son, who survived. According to the Baltimore County Police Department, officers sought to serve Gaines a warrant in relation to an earlier traffic violation. Upon entering her apartment, the police officers were faced with the barrel of a shotgun being pointed at them which prompted them to draw their guns, resulting in a 6 hour long standoff. Gaines' five-year-old son was also grazed by a stray bullet.[2] Portions of the standoff were filmed by Gaines and posted to social-media networking sites where you can see her loading the shotgun, threatening to kill all the police officers outside her house, and attempting to convince her son that the police are there specifically to kill them; however, upon police request, Facebook deactivated Gaines' Facebook and Instagram accounts,[3] leading to criticism of the company's involvement in the incident.[4] In 2018, courts awarded the Gaines family $37 million in damages after finding that the first shot, fired by Royce Ruby and killing Gaines, was not reasonable, and thus violated their civil rights.[5] That verdict was overturned in February of 2019.

Abner Louima Age 30 incident August 9, 1997

On the night of August 9, 1997, the police were called and several officers from the 70th Precinct were dispatched to the scene where Abner Louima and other men got involved in a fight between two females in Club Rendez-Vous, a popular nightclub in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. There were police, supporters, and various people involved in the fight outside the club. Police officers Justin Volpe, Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder, and Thomas Wiese, and others responded to the scene. In the ongoing commotion, Volpe proclaimed Louima was his assailant. Louima was charged with disorderly conduct, obstructing government administration, and resisting arrest. Later, Volpe admitted his accusation about Louima being his assailant was false.[2]

The arresting officers beat Louima with their fists, nightsticks, and hand-held police radios on the ride to the station.[3] On arriving at the station house, he was strip-searched and put in a holding cell. The beating continued later, culminating with Louima being sexually assaulted in a bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. Volpe kicked Louima in the testicles, and while Louima's hands were cuffed behind his back, he first grabbed onto and squeezed his testicles and then sexually assaulted him with a broomstick. According to trial testimony, Volpe then walked through the precinct holding the bloody, excrement-stained instrument in his hand, bragging to a police sergeant that he "took a man down tonight."[4]

Louima's teeth were also badly damaged in the attack by having the broom handle jammed into his mouth.[5] He testified to the presence of a second officer in the bathroom helping Volpe in the assault but could not positively identify him. The identity of the second attacker became a point of serious contention during the trial and appeals. Louima also initially claimed that the officers involved in the attack called him a racial slur and shouted, "This is Giuliani-time" during the beating.[6] Louima later recanted that claim, and the reversal was used by defense lawyers to cast doubt on the entirety of his testimony.[7]

The day after the incident, Louima was taken to the emergency department at Coney Island Hospital. Escorting officers explained away his serious injuries being a result of "abnormal homosexual activities." An ED nurse, Magalie Laurent, suspecting the nature of Louima's extreme injuries were not the result of homosexual sex, notified Louima's family and the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau of the likelihood of sexual assault and battery.[3] The attack left Louima with severe internal damage to his colon and bladder that required three major operations to repair. He was hospitalized for two months after the incident.

Kendrick Johnson October 10, 1995 — January 10, 2013

On January 11, 2013, the body of Kendrick Johnson (October 10, 1995 — January 10, 2013) was discovered inside a rolled up mat in the gymnasium of Lowndes High School in Valdosta, in the U.S. state of Georgia, where he was a student.[1][2][3][4] A preliminary investigation and autopsy concluded that the death was accidental. Johnson's family had a private pathologist conduct a second autopsy which concluded that Johnson died from blunt force trauma. On October 31, 2013, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia announced that his office would open a formal review into Johnson's death. On June 20, 2016, the US DOJ announced that it would not be filing any criminal charges related to Johnson's death.[5] Kendrick Johnson's family filed a $100 million civil lawsuit against 38 individuals. The lawsuit alleged that Johnson's death was a murder and accused the respondents of a conspiracy to cover up the homicide. That lawsuit was subsequently withdrawn. A judge ordered the Johnsons and their attorney to pay more than $292,000 in legal fees to the defendants.[6][7][8] The judge in that case accused the Johnsons and their attorney of fabricating evidence to support their claims.

Austin Harrouff taking into custody
2 killed
1 injured

The night of the attack, a sheriff’s deputy arrived at the house and found Harrouff on top of Stevens, who was lying on the driveway leading to the garage. Mishcon was in the garage.

The deputy realized Harrouff was biting Stevens in the face and used a Taser on Harrouff, but it didn’t work. The deputy tried to pull Harrouff off, but he was exhibiting abnormal levels of strength. Harrouff wasn’t wearing a shirt, and he was described as being muscular.

Two more deputies arrived within a few minutes and tried to help the deputy already on scene. Tequesta and Jupiter police officers also helped, and a Tequesta police K-9 dog was used on Harrouff to get him off Stevens. Officials eventually were able to remove Harrouff, who was bit by the police K-9.

Harrouff hasn’t talked to detectives about the night of the slayings, Snyder said.

Harrouff’s toxicology results while the FBI is analyzing his blood work in Quantico, Virginia. Hospital testing ruled out marijuana, cocaine and opioids, and the FBI is testing for the chemicals found in flakka and bath salts.

Gabriel Ross Parker
2 fatalities
19 injured

At 7:55 AM as students were gathering in an open area prior to the start of classes, 15-year-old student Gabriel Ross Parker, opened fire with a Ruger handgun, killing two 15 year olds at the scene.

Parker reportedly went to the school’s band room to check with his friends before the shooting, to make sure they were not in the area before returning to the commons area and beginning his attack.[5] Witnesses stated that the gunman's eyes were "lifeless" and that he said nothing while he fired at students.[6]

After the shooting he discarded the weapon and ran to the weight room and hid with other students. Students, unaware he was the suspected shooter, motioned for him to join them in hiding.[5] Another student who was hiding in the location, recognized Parker as the shooter and alerted a teacher in the room about the shooters identity, the teacher then called law enforcement.[7]

A large number of students fled the schools campus to seek safety with local business owners attempting to aid the students.[8] Students running from the incident heard screams of "Get down!" but many fled, or attempted to evacuate the wounded from the school and drive them to the hospital. This created chaos as many dropped what they were carrying such as phones and bags and jumped fences or ran into the woods.[9] Many students also ran to the school's technical building on campus.

Eighteen other people were injured, by bullets and the chaos afterwards with three people critically injured.[3] Parker was taken into custody by the Marshall County Sheriff at 8:06 AM.[10]

The mother of the suspect reportedly received a phone call from her son that there had been a shooting and that he was scared. The revelation that her son was the suspected shooter caused her to be physically ill.

Kevin Janson Neal
5 killed
18 injured
On November 13/14, 2017, a series of shootings occurred in Rancho Tehama Reserve, an unincorporated community in Tehama County, California located 120 miles (190 kilometers) northwest of Sacramento.[2] The gunman, 44-year-old Kevin Janson Neal, died by suicide after a Corning police officer rammed and stopped his stolen vehicle.

During the shooting spree, five people were killed and 18 others were injured at eight separate crime scenes, including an elementary school. Ten people suffered bullet wounds and eight were cut by flying glass caused by the gunfire. The injured victims were transported to several area clinics and hospitals.

At the time of the spree, Neal had been freed on bail pending trial for two alleged felonies, and five alleged misdemeanors. Nine months before the shooting rampage, a judge had issued Neal a restraining order at a neighbor's request and ordered him to surrender his guns.[1] The restraining order expired in September, but was renewed before the shootings. He manufactured the rifle and possessed the handguns in violation of that restraining order. At least one unregistered semi-automatic ghost rifle and two borrowed semi-automatic pistols were used.[1] The shootings led to domestic and international debate over the control of ghost guns and gun-licensing law in the United States.

The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting was a mass shooting that occurred at the Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation[a] in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 27, 2018, while Shabbat morning services were being held. Eleven people were killed and seven were injured. It was the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the United States.[5][6]

The sole suspect, 46-year-old Robert Gregory Bowers,[7][8] was arrested and charged with 63 federal crimes, some of which are capital crimes.[9] He has pleaded not guilty.[9] He separately faces 36 charges in Pennsylvania state court.[7][10] Using the online social network Gab,[11] Bowers had earlier posted anti-Semitic comments against the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS)[12][13] in which Dor Hadash[14] and Tree of Life[15] were supporting participants. Referring to Central American migrant caravans and immigrants, he posted on Gab shortly before the attack that "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in."

CP5
The Central Park jogger case was a major news story that involved the assault and rape of Trisha Meili, a white female jogger, and attacks on others in the North Woods of Manhattan's Central Park on the night of April 19, 1989. The attack on the jogger left her in a coma for 12 days. Meili was a 28-year-old investment banker at the time. According to The New York Times, the attack was "one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s".[1]

On the night of the attack, five juvenile males—four African American and one Hispanic—were apprehended in connection with a number of attacks in Central Park committed by around 30 teenage perpetrators. The defendants were tried variously for assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and attempted murder relating to Meili's and other attacks in the park, based solely on confessions that they said were coerced and false. Before the trial, the FBI tested the DNA of the rape kit and found it did not match to any of the tested suspects. The office of District Attorney Robert Morgenthau presented these findings to the press as "inconclusive".[2] They were convicted in 1990 by juries in two separate trials. Subsequently, known as the Central Park Five, they received sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years. Four of the convictions were appealed and the convictions were affirmed by appellate courts. The defendants spent between 6 and 13 years in prison.

In 2002, Matias Reyes, a convicted murderer and serial rapist in prison, confessed to raping the jogger, and DNA evidence confirmed his guilt. He knew facts about the crime that only the offender could have known, and also said he committed the rape alone.[3] At the time of his confession, Reyes was already serving a life sentence. He was not prosecuted for raping Meili, because the statute of limitations had passed by the time he confessed. Morgenthau suggested to the court that the five men's convictions related to the assault and rape of Meili and to attacks on others to which they had confessed be vacated (a legal position in which the parties are treated as though no trial has taken place) and withdrew the charges. Their convictions were vacated in 2002.

The five convicted men sued New York City in 2003 for malicious prosecution, racial discrimination, and emotional distress. The city refused to settle the suits for a decade under then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, because the city's lawyers felt they would win. However, after Bill de Blasio became mayor and supported the settlement, the city settled the case for $41 million in 2014. As of December 2014, the five men were pursuing an additional $52 million in damages from New York State in the New York Court of Claims.
