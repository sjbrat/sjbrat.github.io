      <p>Booker, 23, first made national headlines in April after a video of her being brutally attacked by a group of men went viral. During the beating, a crowd shouted homophobic slurs at her. According to a police report, Booker suffered a concussion, fractured wrist and other injuries as a result of the assault.
      </p>
      <p>
      One man, 29-year-old Edward Thomas, was arrested and jailed for aggravated assault for the April assault on Booker. As CBS notes, although the attack was flagged as a hate crime, gender identity is not covered under Texas’ hate crime laws.
      </p>
      <p>
      Booker spoke out after the attack. “This time, I can stand before you,” she said in a press conference after the video had been widely circulated online, “whereas, in other scenarios, we are at a memorial.”

      <p>On January 24th, 2017, inside one of the bathroom of his elementary school, several sadistic children were harassing, insulting, threatening, and slapping around kids as Gabe also enters the bathroom. As the bully walks up to a startled Gabe, the unnamed and unidentified bully with the rest of his gang of misfits begin the onslaught of abuse against Gabe. Gabe extends his hand and offers a handshake to the bully.
      </p>

      <p>Instead, of accepting the handshake, the assailant grabs him and slams him against the wall. Gabe lands unconscious on the floor and according to the unreleased footage seen and reported by authorities, the bully along with his crew descend further into a violent assault. The bullies eventually leave Gabe unconscious inside the bathroom until the assistant principal finds him about 7 minutes later.
      </p>

      <p>At that time, the school followed protocol and had the school nurse inspect Gabe. The school officials never disclosed to Gabe's mother he had been bullied and unconscious for quite some time. Instead, they informed his mother that he had feinted. When Gabe came home, he seemed sick and began puking, so his mother took him to the hospital to get checked. The diagnoses that he received was that he had stomach flu.
      </p>

      <p>Gabe missed school the following day in order to recuperate. On January 26th, he attended school again and was harassed a second time. When he came home, Gabe decided to take his own life by hanging himself.
      </p>

      <p>Gabe's mother has stated that she had contacted the school for she was worried that Gabe was being bullied. The school responded by saying they don't have records of any reports concerning bullying. Gabe's mother has come out an expressed the school's statements are wrong.

      <p>On the night of August 6, 2004, 16-year-old Brown met 43-year-old Johnny Michael Allen in the parking lot of a Sonic Drive-In on Murfreesboro Road in Nashville, Tennessee. Allen was a real estate broker and a United States Army veteran.  Based on what Brown told investigators, Allen asked her if she was hungry and if she was homeless.  Brown answered yes to both questions and accepted Allen's offer to take her to his house. Brown and Allen ordered dinner and Allen drove the pair to his home.  At a later hearing, Brown testified that she agreed to have sex with Allen for US$150, but claimed that they never actually engaged in sexual intercourse.  At some point during the encounter Brown shot Allen in the back of the head using her .40-caliber handgun. She then left the house in Allen's Ford F-150 in possession of Allen's wallet, containing US$172, and two of his firearms.  Brown left the truck at a Wal-Mart parking lot and flagged down an SUV for a ride home. Police later found Brown and Garion McGlothen at the nearby Intown Suites.
      </p>

      <p>Brown was arrested and charged with homicide, especially aggravated robbery, handgun possession and criminal impersonation.  Despite being under 18 at the time of the killing, she was tried as an adult. This decision came from Metro Juvenile Court Judge Betty Adams Green on November 14, 2004, who argued that it was too much of a risk to the community to keep the 16-year-old in the Juvenile Court System.
      </p>

      <p>Brown is serving her sentence at the Tennessee Prison for Women, a maximum security detention facility in Nashville, Tennessee.  She would have been eligible for parole at age 67.  In prison Brown has earned her high school diploma, as well as an associate degree with a 4.0 GPA. She is working towards her bachelor's degree and is on track to earn it in May 2019.
      </p>

      <p>Brown's former pimp, Garion L. McGlothen, also known as Gary McGlothen and Kutthroat, died on March 30, 2005, at the age of 24, having been shot and killed by Quartez Hines.</p>

      <p>On January 7, 2019, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam commuted Cyntoia Brown's sentence of life in prison to an August 7, 2019 release, plus 10 years of supervised parole.

      <p>On June 20, 2018, at 10:30 p.m., 15-year-old Lesandro "Junior" Guzman-Feliz left his apartment to meet up with a friend.  While out, he noticed four vehicles and became alarmed. He began to run and was chased for several blocks by gang members occupying the vehicles.  Eventually, Guzman-Feliz sought refuge in a bodega at Bathgate Avenue and East 183rd Street in Belmont, Bronx, near his residence. Five members of the Dominican gang Trinitarios followed him into the bodega, where he was then dragged by vehicle occupants onto the sidewalk in front of the store where three others were waiting. Store owners and others witnessed the attack; the bodega's owner tried to hide Guzman-Feliz behind the counter, but Junior was soon spotted by one of the gang members and was dragged outside.</p>

      <p>The incident was captured on CCTV video inside the shop, as well as on cell phone video taken from an overhead angle by a resident of one of the building's upper floors. The cell phone video shows a dozen or more males arriving and departing at the scene. Bodega surveillance footage shows several men stabbing Guzman-Feliz with large knives and machetes.  The video shows Guzman-Feliz re-entering the store; however, he appeared to be sent outside. The video shows him stumbling out of the bodega and running east on 183rd Street toward St. Barnabas Hospital, a few blocks away. Cell phone footage showed Guzman-Feliz collapse on a step at a security booth near the hospital entrance. The video shows witnesses who knew the victim screaming frantically, holding cloths to his wounds, and attempting to console him as he died. Guzman-Feliz' death occurred only minutes after the attack at the bodega.  Two police officers were standing nearby, but allegedly did little to help.</p>

      <p>According to the boyfriend of Guzman-Feliz's sister, a Trinitario gang leader stated on Snapchat that the killing was a case of mistaken identity. Initial reports indicated that the incident was sparked by a sex video involving a gang member's niece and a curly-haired male teenager, who looked very similar to Guzman-Feliz. The gang apologized for the killing to the victim's family on social media. In addition, the gang leader kicked the killers out of the gang as a result of this mistaken identity killing.  Police indicated, though, that the alleged killers, all members of the Trinitarios subset "Los Sures", mistakenly believed that Guzman-Feliz was a member of the rival gang "Sunset".</p>

      <p>Two young white girls, 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 7-year-old Mary Emma Thames, were found dead in the company mill town of Alcolu, South Carolina, in March 1944, after they had failed to return home the night before.  Police arrested 14-year-old George Stinney, as a suspect. They said that he confessed to the crime to them.  There was no written record of his confession apart from notes provided by an investigating deputy.</p>

      <p>No transcript was recorded of the brief trial. Stinney was convicted of first-degree murder of the two girls in less than 10 minutes by an all-white jury, during a one-day trial.  The court refused to hear his appeal. He was executed that year, still age 14, by electric chair.</p>

      <p>In the decades since Stinney's conviction and execution, the question of his guilt, the validity of his reported confession, and the judicial process leading to his execution have been extensively criticized.  A group of lawyers and activists investigated the Stinney case on behalf of his family. In 2013 the family petitioned for a new trial. On December 17, 2014, his conviction was posthumously vacated 70 years after his execution, because the circuit court judge ruled that he had not been given a fair trial; he had no effective defense representation and his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated.  The judgment noted that while Stinney could have committed the crime, the prosecution and trial were fundamentally flawed.  Judge Mullen ruled that his confession was likely coerced and thus inadmissible. She also found that the execution of a 14-year-old constituted "cruel and unusual punishment."</p>

      <p>George Stinney was executed at the Central Correctional Institution in Columbia on June 16, 1944, at 7:30 p.m.  Standing 5 feet 1 inch (155 cm) tall and weighing just over 90 pounds (40 kg), Stinney was so small compared to the usual adult prisoners that law officers had difficulty securing him to the frame holding the electrodes. Stinney was made to sit on a Bible in order to fit properly into the chair.  The state's adult-sized face-mask did not fit him; as he was hit with the first 2,400-volt surge of electricity, the mask covering his face slipped off.  Stinney was declared dead within four minutes of the initial electrocution. From the time of the murders until Stinney's execution, 83 days had passed.</p>

      <p>Rosfeld had been sworn in to the East Pittsburgh Police Department only a few hours before the shooting, and trained with the department for three weeks prior. He had seven years experience with other police departments, including those in the Pennsylvania towns of Oakmont and Harmar, and the University of Pittsburgh.  On Tuesday, June 19, 2018 there was a drive-by shooting in North Braddock around 8:30 p.m. Police later said that witnesses described a car similar to the silver Chevrolet Cruze that Rose and two others were seen in nearby. Police stopped the car, which investigators said had clearly been hit by bullets, at 8:40 p.m.  A video recording taken by a bystander shows police ordering the driver to step out from the car.  While the driver was being handcuffed, Rose and the third occupant, Zaijuan Hester, attempted to evade arrest by running from the car.  Rosfeld fired three rounds, and Rose was struck by all three.  He was pronounced dead at McKeesport Hospital.  In the video, a woman's voice is heard saying, "Why they shooting at him? All they did was run and they shooting at them."  Police said that Rose had been unarmed when he was shot.  Hester escaped, but was later arrested.

Two others were wounded in the shooting.    All three victims were transported to a hospital, where Hussle was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. He was 33 years old.</p>

      <p>Hussle wanted to focus on “giving solutions and inspiration” to young black men like him.  He denounced gun violence through his music, influence and community work.  He spoke openly about his experiences with gang culture.  He not only funded improvements to neighborhood schools but also spent time with students and participated on panels about growing up in the area and the influence of gang culture.  Hussle started a co-working environment which he named Vector 90.  From his own experience, he saw the Crenshaw area as being under served and that young people would benefit from communal workspaces.  He also intended young people to be able to take classes in science, technology and mathematics at the center.</p>

      <p>In March 2019, Hussle had contacted officials from the LAPD to arrange a meeting with him and Roc Nation about what they could do to help prevent gang violence in South Los Angeles.

      <p>When Everett Palmer arrived in Pennsylvania in 2018 to resolve the DUI, police saw a suspension on his license and he was sent to York County Prison, Dwayne Palmer said.  After that, what happened to Everett Palmer is not clearly known.</p>

      <p>According to the York County coroner’s report and autopsy results released in July 2018, Palmer was being held in a single cell at York County Prison on April 9, 2018, when he “became agitated and began hitting his head against the inside of his cell door.” Officers “restrained” Palmer, but after the incident he was taken to the prison’s clinic and was “noted to be unresponsive.”  Staff tried to resuscitate Palmer, and he was transferred to York Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:46 a.m.</p>

      <p>The coroner’s office ruled his official cause of death as “complication following an excited state, associated with methamphetamine toxicity, during physical restraint.” A sickle-cell disorder was said to be a probable contributing factor. The manner of death was undetermined.  Lee Merritt, the Palmer family lawyer, told the Washington Post that the family had been shocked to receive Everett Palmer’s body with his heart, brain and throat missing, and that it was not immediately communicated to them where the body parts were. </p>

Awaiting his trial, Browder was jailed on Rikers Island for three years, nearly two of which were spent in solitary confinement. He was released when the prosecutor's case was found to be lacking evidence against Browder and the case's main witness had left the United States. Two years after his release from prison, Browder died after hanging himself from an air conditioning unit outside his mother's home. Browder's supporters say his suicide was the result of mental, physical and sexual abuse sustained in prison.

      <p>In 1994, Michael Alonzo Thompson, A.K.A. “Meeko,” sold three pounds of pot to the manager of a car muffler shop in Flint, Michigan. He knew the man from going there to get his car fixed. What he didn’t know was that he’d had been pressured to take part in a sting by the Flint Area Narcotics Group (FANG). Thompson got busted and police searched his house, where they found three guns, two of which were antiques and another gun that belonged to his wife. Even though he hadn’t been armed at the time of the sale, prosecutors slapped him with a long list of charges including possession of a firearm while committing a felony – a pretty big stretch, since he didn’t have a gun on him when he allegedly sold the weed. Because he had priors – including three cocaine convictions dating back to 1982 – Thompson was deemed a habitual offender and sentenced to 40 to 60 years in prison. Now 66, he’s spent two decades behind bars.</p>

      <p>On March 3, 1991, King was violently beaten by LAPD officers during his arrest for fleeing and evading on California State Route 210. A civilian filmed the incident from his nearby balcony and sent the footage to local news station KTLA. The footage clearly showed King being beaten repeatedly, and the incident was covered by news media around the world.</p>

      <p>King was taken to Pacifica Hospital after his arrest, where he was found to have suffered a fractured facial bone, a broken right ankle, and multiple bruises and lacerations.  In a negligence claim filed with the city, King alleged he had suffered "11 skull fractures, permanent brain damage, broken [bones and teeth], kidney failure [and] emotional and physical trauma".  Blood and urine samples taken from King five hours after his arrest showed that he would have been intoxicated under California law at the time of his arrest. Pacifica Hospital nurses reported that the officers who accompanied King (including Wind) openly joked and bragged about the number of times they had hit King.  Officers obtained King's identification from his clothes pockets at that time. King later sued the city for damages and a jury awarded him $3.8 million, as well as $1.7 million in attorney's fees.  The city did not pursue charges against King for driving while intoxicated and evading arrest. District Attorney Ira Reiner believed there was insufficient evidence for prosecution.  His successor Gil Garcetti thought that by December 1992, too much time had passed to charge King with evading arrest; he also noted that the statute of limitations on drunk driving had passed.  In 2012, he was found dead in his swimming pool two months after publishing his memoir.
      </p>

      <p>The federal government prosecuted a separate civil rights case, obtaining grand jury indictments for violations by the four officers of King's civil rights. Their trial in a federal district court ended on April 16, 1993, with two of the officers being found guilty and sentenced to prison. The other two were acquitted of the charges.</p>

      <p>Ryan was sitting in his parked car with a friend when LA County Deputies arrived on the scene. Upon the officer’s arrival, an unnamed female relative of Twyman’s moved to leave the area in fear that the police would harass them, but when Twyman tried to leave in his car, he was blocked in by the officers. Several witnesses claim that Ryan’s friend then opened the passenger door of the car, and the cops proceeded to drag the friend out and beat him. Amid the commotion, an officer claimed to have seen a gun which caused another deputy to open fire, shooting at Ryan.  According to eyewitnesses, after emptying the entire clip, the officer went to his car and grabbed his rifle, only to begin shooting at Ryan again.  There is no information or statements from the LAPD on this matter, so far. However, multiple witnesses have said that Ryan was unarmed and there has yet to be evidence of a gun on the scene.</p>

      <p>Army Sgt. La David T. Johnson died in a hail of gunfire, hit as many as 18 times as he took cover in thick brush, fighting to the end after fleeing militants who had just killed three comrades in an October ambush in Niger, The Associated Press reports.</p>

      <p>The bodies of three U.S. Green Berets were located on the day of the attack, but not Johnson's remains. The gap in time led to questions about whether Johnson was killed in the assault and not found, or if he was taken away by the enemy.  Partial remains were found about five weeks after he was killed in an ambush in Niger last month, the Pentagon said, raising more questions about the operation that led to the deaths of four elite U.S. soldiers.

      <p>On the night of August 9, 1997, the police were called and several officers from the 70th Precinct were dispatched to the scene where Abner Louima and other men got involved in a fight between two females in Club Rendez-Vous, a popular nightclub in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. There were police, supporters, and various people involved in the fight outside the club. Police officers Justin Volpe, Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder, Thomas Wiese, and others responded to the scene. In the ongoing commotion, Volpe proclaimed Louima was his assailant. Louima was charged with disorderly conduct, obstructing government administration, and resisting arrest. Later, Volpe admitted his accusation about Louima being his assailant was false.</p>

      <p>The arresting officers beat Louima with their fists, nightsticks, and hand-held police radios on the ride to the station. On arriving at the station house, he was strip-searched and put in a holding cell. The beating continued later, culminating with Louima being sexually assaulted in a bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. Volpe kicked Louima in the testicles, and while Louima's hands were cuffed behind his back, he first grabbed onto and squeezed his testicles and then sexually assaulted him with a broomstick. According to trial testimony, Volpe then walked through the precinct holding the bloody, excrement-stained instrument in his hand, bragging to a police sergeant that he "took a man down tonight."</p>

      <p>Louima's teeth were also badly damaged in the attack by having the broom handle jammed into his mouth.  He testified to the presence of a second officer in the bathroom helping Volpe in the assault but could not positively identify him. The identity of the second attacker became a point of serious contention during the trial and appeals. Louima also initially claimed that the officers involved in the attack called him a racial slur and shouted, "This is Giuliani-time" during the beating.  Louima later recanted that claim, and the reversal was used by defense lawyers to cast doubt on the entirety of his testimony.</p>

      <p>The day after the incident, Louima was taken to the emergency department at Coney Island Hospital. Escorting officers explained away his serious injuries being a result of "abnormal homosexual activities." An ED nurse, Magalie Laurent, suspecting the nature of Louima's extreme injuries were not the result of homosexual sex, notified Louima's family and the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau of the likelihood of sexual assault and battery.  The attack left Louima with severe internal damage to his colon and bladder that required three major operations to repair. He was hospitalized for two months after the incident.</p>

      <p>On August 7, 2015, surveillance videos at an Arlington car dealership show Taylor pulling up at the front of the dealership around 1:00 a.m. Taylor began wandering around the dealership parking lot before smashing the windows of several vehicles. A security guard then called the 911 and six Arlington police arrived at the scene.  There they discovered that Taylor had driven his car through the dealership’s window and entered its showroom on foot. While five officers remained outside of the showroom, anticipating that they could capture Taylor without incident, Brad Miller—a 49-year old rookie police officer still on probation and without previous policing experience—pursued Taylor inside the dealership on his own. Miller confronted Taylor, ordering him to get down on the showroom floor.  What occurred next is uncertain, but Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson later stated that Taylor refused to comply with Officer Miller’s orders and began to actively advance toward the officer.  Miller shot Taylor, who was about seven feet away.  As Taylor continued to approach Miller, the officer shot him again three times, killing him.</p>

      <p>Miller was fired four days after the shooting death of Christian Taylor. A grand jury in Arlington, however, did not charge him with any crime related to the shooting death of Taylor.  An autopsy revealed that Taylor had a mixture of drugs in his system at the time of his death, including marijuana and a powerful hallucinogen LSD-like substance nicknamed N-Bomb.

      <p>The Central Park jogger case was a major news story that involved the assault and rape of Trisha Meili, a white female jogger, and attacks on others in the North Woods of Manhattan's Central Park on the night of April 19, 1989. The attack on the jogger left her in a coma for 12 days. Meili was a 28-year-old investment banker at the time. According to The New York Times, the attack was "one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s".</p>

      <p>On the night of the attack, five juvenile males—four African American and one Hispanic—were apprehended in connection with a number of attacks in Central Park committed by around 30 teenage perpetrators. The defendants were tried variously for assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and attempted murder relating to Meili's and other attacks in the park, based solely on confessions that they said were coerced and false. Before the trial, the FBI tested the DNA of the rape kit and found it did not match to any of the tested suspects. The office of District Attorney Robert Morgenthau presented these findings to the press as "inconclusive".  They were convicted in 1990 by juries in two separate trials. Subsequently, known as the Central Park Five, they received sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years. Four of the convictions were appealed and the convictions were affirmed by appellate courts. The defendants spent between 6 and 13 years in prison.</p>

      <p>In 2002, Matias Reyes, a convicted murderer and serial rapist in prison, confessed to raping the jogger, and DNA evidence confirmed his guilt. He knew facts about the crime that only the offender could have known, and also said he committed the rape alone.  At the time of his confession, Reyes was already serving a life sentence. He was not prosecuted for raping Meili, because the statute of limitations had passed by the time he confessed. Morgenthau suggested to the court that the five men's convictions related to the assault and rape of Meili and to attacks on others to which they had confessed be vacated (a legal position in which the parties are treated as though no trial has taken place) and withdrew the charges. Their convictions were vacated in 2002.</p>

      <p>The five convicted men sued New York City in 2003 for malicious prosecution, racial discrimination, and emotional distress. The city refused to settle the suits for a decade under then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, because the city's lawyers felt they would win. However, after Bill de Blasio became mayor and supported the settlement, the city settled the case for $41 million in 2014. As of December 2014, the five men were pursuing an additional $52 million in damages from New York State in the New York Court of Claims.

      <p>On April 12, 2015, Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr., a 25-year-old black man, was arrested by the Baltimore Police Department for possessing what the police alleged was an illegal knife under Baltimore law.  While being transported in a police van, Gray fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center.  Gray died on April 19, 2015; his death was ascribed to injuries to his spinal cord.  On April 21, 2015, pending an investigation of the incident, six Baltimore police officers were suspended with pay.</p>

      <p>The circumstances of the injuries were initially unclear; eyewitness accounts suggested that the officers involved used unnecessary force against Gray during the arrest—a claim denied by all officers involved.  Commissioner Anthony W. Batts reported that, contrary to department policy, the officers did not secure him inside the van while driving to the police station; this policy had been put into effect six days prior to Gray's arrest, following review of other transport-related injuries sustained during police custody in the city, and elsewhere in the country during the preceding years.  The medical investigation found that Gray had sustained the injuries while in transport.  The medical examiner's office concluded that Gray's death could not be ruled an accident, and was instead a homicide, because officers failed to follow safety procedures "through acts of omission."  On May 1, 2015, the Baltimore City State's Attorney, Marilyn Mosby, announced her office had filed charges against six police officers after the medical examiner's report ruled Gray's death a homicide.

      <p>James Byrd Jr. was a black man who was murdered by three white supremacists in Jasper, Texas, on June 7, 1998. Shawn Berry, Lawrence Brewer, and John King dragged Byrd for three miles behind a pickup truck along an asphalt road. Byrd, who remained conscious throughout most of his ordeal, was killed about halfway through the dragging when his body hit the edge of a culvert, severing his right arm and head. The murderers drove on for another ​1 1⁄2 miles (2.4 km) before dumping his torso in front of a black cemetery in Jasper.  Byrd's lynching-by-dragging gave impetus to passage of a Texas hate-crimes law. It later led to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, commonly known as the Matthew Shepard Act, which became federal law in 2009.

According to the Baltimore County Police Department, officers sought to serve Gaines a warrant in relation to an earlier traffic violation. Upon entering her apartment, the police officers were faced with the barrel of a shotgun being pointed at them which prompted them to draw their guns, resulting in a 6 hour long standoff. Gaines' five-year-old son was also grazed by a stray bullet.  Portions of the standoff were filmed by Gaines and posted to social-media networking sites where you can see her loading the shotgun, threatening to kill all the police officers outside her house, and attempting to convince her son that the police are there specifically to kill them; however, upon police request, Facebook deactivated Gaines' Facebook and Instagram accounts, leading to criticism of the company's involvement in the incident.  In 2018, courts awarded the Gaines family $37 million in damages after finding that the first shot, fired by Royce Ruby and killing Gaines, was not reasonable, and thus violated their civil rights.  That verdict was overturned in February of 2019.

      <p>Sandra Bland was a 28-year-old African-American woman who was found hanged in a jail cell in Waller County, Texas, on July 13, 2015, three days after being arrested during a traffic stop.  Her death was ruled a suicide. It was followed by protests against her arrest, disputing the cause of death, and alleging racial violence against her.</p>

      <p>Bland was pulled over for a traffic violation on July 10 by State Trooper Brian Encinia. The exchange escalated, resulting in Bland's arrest and charge for assaulting a police officer. The arrest was partially recorded by Encinia's dashcam and by a bystander's cell phone. After authorities reviewed the dashcam footage, Encinia was placed on administrative leave for failing to follow proper traffic stop procedures.

      <p>Tamir Rice a 12-year-old African-American boy was shot by 26-year-old white police officer Timothy Loehman on 22 November 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio.  The shooting by officer Timothy Loehmann resulted in Tamir Rice's death. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded after receiving a police dispatch call of a black male that "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people".  A caller reported that a male was pointing "a pistol" at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At the beginning of the call and again in the middle he says of the pistol "it's probably fake".  Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated "he is probably a juvenile".  However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch.  The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled "show me your hands" through the open patrol car window. Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw: "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out".  In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso.  He died on the following day.

      <p>The shooting of Walter Scott occurred on April 4, 2015, in North Charleston, South Carolina, following a daytime traffic stop for a non-functioning brake light. Scott, an unarmed black man, was murdered by Michael Slager, a white North Charleston police officer.  Slager was charged with murder after a video surfaced which showed him shooting Scott from behind while Scott was fleeing, and which contradicted his police report. The race difference led many to believe that the shooting was racially motivated, generating a widespread controversy.
